## The Man Who Lost His Dog 
There was a man who had a dog, its name was James. James was nearing 3 years old (in dog age), and figured that it was prime time to start a family. He ran away from the home to start his new adventure, really to get rid of his bachelor status. The poor old man cried and collapsed on the ground in absolute sadness. On the bright side, James had found a beautiful samoyed chow chow named Lydia. They settled down in a park 10 miles from the old man, and had 4 pups together. To this day, James and Lydia go on strolls and eat out every Friday night. 

*Moral of the story*: life goes on!
