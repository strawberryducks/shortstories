#### 1: The Man Who Lost His Dog 
There was a man who had a dog, its name was James. James was nearing 3 years old (in dog age), and figured that it was prime time to start a family. He ran away from home to start his new adventure, really to get rid of his bachelor status. James was beyond excited, scampering out the front door without a single look back. Meanwhile, the poor old man realized that his dog was missing after coming in from the backyard garden. Despite searching the whole house, he could not find even a shadow of James. Finally, the old man broke down--he cried and collapsed on the ground in absolute sadness, body slumped in fetal position. On the bright side, James had found a beautiful samoyed chow chow named Lydia. It was like love at first sight. They settled down in a park 10 miles from the old man, and had 4 pups together. To this day, James and Lydia go on strolls and eat out every Friday night.  
*Moral of the story*: life goes on!
